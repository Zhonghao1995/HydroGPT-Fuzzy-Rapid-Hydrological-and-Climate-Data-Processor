Functional Overview

Weather Data Scraper

Fetches daily or hourly climate data from external websites (e.g., Environment Canada).

Automatically parses HTML tables, cleans invalid values, and exports results to CSV.

Data Cleaning

Loads CSV/Excel files.

Removes rows containing user-specified invalid values or nulls.

Exports the cleaned file in CSV or Excel format.

Preprocessing

Extract Columns: Select common columns across multiple files, combine into one dataset.

Merge Files: Merge multiple datasets by time columns (pair-wise or bulk) and export.

GPT Processing

Convert to JSONL: Transforms Excel/CSV data into multi-turn JSONL for GPT-based tasks (chat or fine-tuning).

Train Model (Legacy): Demonstrates how to process a JSONL file with OpenAI’s legacy approach.

JSONL Parser: Extracts structured info from GPT responses via regex patterns.

Fuzzy Analysis

Allows Triangular or Trapezoidal membership functions for numeric columns.

Supports alpha-cuts, membership calculation, and interactive plots.

Exports fuzzy-transformed data to CSV/Excel.

NSE Evaluation

Loads observation and simulation columns.

Calculates R², NSE, RMSE, MAE for hydrological model performance.

Plots observed vs. simulated data.

Card-Based Login

User must enter a valid card number & password.

The system verifies credentials with a remote server.

Prevents unauthorized usage.
